## About The Project

<img src="images/Screenshot-home-screen.png" alt="Screenshot-home-page">

myExpenses is an easy to use expense tracking web app. 
It was originally built using PHP and MySQL in the year 2018 during my first year at college and is hosted at [myexpenses.epizy.com](https://myexpenses.epizy.com). And later in 2020 decided to shift the code base to ReactJS.
